Project: Phishing email detector for Binghamton students

Project Members: Dimitra Pando, Zak Sujkovic, Akhilan Jeyaraj, Caleb Lai

Many Binghamton University students receive fradulent phishing emails. To help these students, we have developed a Chrome extension capable of detecting phishing emails by using a machine learning model and a keywork detection system.

The extension's user interface is simple and relies on a button to start scanning. When a user has an email opened, they can press a button that will begin scanning their email. Another feature that this extension includes is a drop down menu where users can select how many emails to scan. At the bottom of the extension, a message displays whether the email can be considered phishing or not. The machine learning part of the project collects emails to use as a dataset which is crucial for training the model. The machine learning model looks for any suspicious links within the email, wheter the sender of the email has a Binghamton Univeristy associated email, and looks for key words that are used in phishing emails. These features are important for the machine learning model to select because they are key indicators whether an email can be considered phishing or not.
